BUGFIX: Display Watchdog Reset Issue
=====================================

Problem:
--------
Display device was crashing with watchdog reset:
- Serial output showed: "ets Jul 29 2019 12:21:46"
- Device would boot, show "Display ready!", then crash
- Sender was working correctly

Root Cause:
-----------
The CSV parsing while-loop in loop() was taking too long without
yielding to the watchdog timer. ESP32's watchdog requires tasks
to yield periodically (every ~1-2 seconds) or it triggers a reset.

The parsing loop had:
1. Multiple String operations (indexOf, substring)
2. Multiple TFT operations per key-value pair
3. No yield() calls
4. No iteration limit

This caused the loop to run too long without feeding the watchdog.

Solution:
---------
Added multiple yield() calls:

1. yield() in the parsing while-loop (line 142)
   - Feeds watchdog every iteration
   - Prevents long processing blocks

2. yield() after fillRect() (line 134)
   - TFT operations can be slow
   - Give watchdog time during screen updates

3. yield() before message count update (line 171)
   - Additional safety before more TFT ops

4. Added itemCount limit (max 8 items)
   - Prevents infinite loops
   - Limits worst-case execution time

5. Moved Serial.println() BEFORE TFT ops
   - Debug output happens first
   - Can see what was received even if TFT crashes

Testing:
--------
To verify fix works:

1. Upload fixed Display_Device.ino
2. Check serial output - should see:
   - "Display ready!"
   - "RX [1]: SEQ:1,LED:ON,..."
   - No watchdog reset
   - No "ets Jul 29 2019..." message

3. Display should show:
   - Header "SIMPLE DISPLAY"
   - Parsed key-value pairs
   - Message counter incrementing
   - No crashes or resets

Alternative Solution (if still crashes):
----------------------------------------
If yield() doesn't fix it, simplify to raw display:

// Simple version (like Test_Display_Incremental)
if (msg.length() > 0) {
  tft.fillRect(0, 60, 320, 30, COLOR_BG);
  tft.setCursor(10, 60);
  tft.setTextSize(1);
  tft.print(msg);  // Show raw message, no parsing
}

This is guaranteed to work (tested in Test_Display_Incremental).

Technical Notes:
----------------
- ESP32 watchdog timeout: ~2 seconds (configurable)
- yield() is equivalent to vTaskDelay(0)
- Alternative: esp_task_wdt_reset() (manual feed)
- TFT operations can take 10-50ms each
- String operations allocate memory (fragmentation risk)
